# Privacy Q&A

This notice describes how OpenUPM (or _openupm_), collects and uses data about you.

## What's most important?

OpenUPM is a service that encourages the use and development of the open source unity contents. We try to minimize the information we collected while provide value for you. If you feel uncomfortable about the privacy policy, please mail to hello@openupm.com to start a conversation.

## How does openupm collect data about me?

openupm collects data about you:

* when `openupm`, `npm` or another program to access the [openupm public registry](https://package.openupm.com)
* when you browse the openupm website, [openupm.com](https://openupm.com)
* when you send support, privacy, legal, and other requests to openupm

## What data does openupm collect about me, and why?

### openupm collects data about how you use openupm software and registries.

When you use the `openupm` command, the `npm` command, or other software to work with the openupm public registry, openupm logs data that might be identified to you:

* a random, unique identifier for necessary registry actions
* the names and versions of your project's dependencies, their dependencies, and so on, that come from the openupm public registry
* the versions of Node.js, the `openupm` command, and the operating system you are using
* data about the software you're using to access the registry, such as the `User-Agent` string
* network request data, such as the date and time, your IP address, and the URL

openupm uses this data to:

* fulfill your requests, such as by sending the packages you ask for
* keep registries working quickly and reliably
* debug and develop the `openupm` command and other software
* defend registries from abuse and technical attacks
* compile statistics on package usage and popularity
* prepare reports on trends in the developer community
* improve search results on the website
* recommend packages that may be relevant to your work

openupm usually deletes registry log entries with identifiable information within a few weeks, but may preserve logs longer, as needed in specific cases, like investigations of specific incidents. openupm stores aggregate statistics indefinitely, but those statistics don't include data identifiable to you personally.

### openupm collects data about how you use the website.

When you visit [openupm.com](https://openupm.com), and other openupm websites, openupm uses cookies, server logs, and other methods to collect data about what pages you visit, and when. openupm also collects technical information about the software and computer you use, such as:

* your IP address
* your preferred language
* the web browser software you use
* the kind of computer you use
* the website that referred you

openupm uses data about how you use the website to:

* optimize the website, so that it's quick and easy to use
* diagnose and debug technical errors
* defend the website from abuse and technical attacks
* compile statistics on package popularity
* compile statistics on the kinds of software and computers visitors use
* compile statistics on visitor searches and needs, to guide development of new website pages and functionality
* decide who to contact about about product announcements, service changes, and new features

openupm usually deletes website log entries with identifiable information within a few weeks, but keeps entries for visitors with openupm accounts, and visitors using paid services like Enterprise registries, longer. openupm reviews log entries for those users twice a year, and deletes entries when they're no longer needed.

openupm may preserve log entries for all kinds of visitors longer, as needed in specific cases, like investigation of specific incidents. openupm stores aggregate statistics indefinitely, but those statistics don't include data identifiable to you personally.

### openupm collects account data.

A few features of openupm services requires GitHub account. For example, you must have an GitHub account to submit packages to the openupm public registry.

openupm publishes these account data for the whole world to see on package detail page and contributor pages and so on.

If you preferred not to show your GitHub username, you can leave it empty when submitting packages.

openupm uses your GitHub account data to:

* add metadata to packages that you submit
* contact you in special circumstances related to your account or packages
* contact you about support requests
* contact you about legal requests, like DMCA takedown requests and privacy complaints

openupm stores that data as long as it stores the package.

### openupm collects package data.

When you submit new package to openupm, openupm collects the contents of the package, plus [metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metadata), including your account data. Other openupm users may also publish packages that include data about you, such as the fact that you contributed code to a package.

openupm uses data in packages to provide those packages to you and others who request them, when you publish a package to the openupm public registry, or change a package from private to public, openupm makes the package and metadata available to everyone, online.

Making package data available to others allows them to download, build on, and depend on your work. In the vast majority of cases, openupm stores data in and metadata about every version of every package indefinitely, unless it's unpublished.

In some cases, however, package owner can unpublish packages, erasing them from the public registry. Erased packages linger on for a short time in openupm's public and private caches, but eventually disappear completely from openupm's storage.

### openupm collects data about correspondence.

openupm collects data about you when you send openupm support requests, legal complaints, privacy inquiries, and business inquiries. Those data usually include your name and email address, and may include your company or other affiliation.

openupm uses contact data to:

* respond to you
* compile aggregate statistics about correspondence
* train support staff and other openupm personnel
* review the performance of openupm personnel who respond
* defend openupm from legal claims

openupm stores correspondence as long as it may be useful for these purposes.
